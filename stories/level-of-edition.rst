We offer 3 levels of edition depending on your needs:

* **basic** : we correct grammar, spelling and make sure the tenses are correct and coherent. 

* **fluid** : 'basic' editing + we improve the flow and readability of sentences by adding typical english adverbs and by rewriting or cutting up sentences if necessary.

* **sexy**: 'fluid' editing + we work on the content of the text and we give our objective scientific input to make your document biologist - especially journal editor and reviewer! - friendly. We rewrite paragraphs that may need clarification and we provide suggestions to increase the strength of the text and the impact of the figures.
