About Melanie
-------------


I usually say I am 'British from France', ie. brought up by British parents on the French Riviera, where I also did all my schooling. Not British like my cousins, nor French like my pals, just British from France, Bri-ench or Fren-tish I could say. 

Apart from that, I have a PhD. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis where I studied biology for nine years, from my first year at university, to my last. 

I did my PhD in Stéphane Noselli's laboratory at the iBV (http://ibv.unice.fr/EN/index.php) in Nice where I studied the role of the JNK pathway in epithelial morphogenesis during Drosophila embryogenesis. Then I spent slightly more than a year travelling on a bicycle throughout Europe, India and South East Asia before signing up as a post-doc in Magali Suzanne's lab in Toulouse (France). There I studied the role of apoptosis on epithelial morphogenesis during Drosophila metamorphosis. 

During both my PhD and post-doc, I worked in tight collaboration with two brilliant physicists for the biomechanical modelling of morphogenesis. Fanny Serman also a PhD student in Stéphane Noselli's lab and Guillaume Gay (founder of DamCB (http://damcb.com/) during my post-doc Magali Suzanne's lab. Thus, I am very acquainted to discussing subjects that are not necessarily my speciality or cup of tea. 

As an native english speaker working in french labs, I have very often been asked to correct articles and grants before submission. As a graduate student, I daren't do more editing than what I was asked, mostly the grammar and rephrasing. However as the years went by, I realised I also enjoyed giving scientific input. Furthermore, I was very keen on writing when it came to my own documents (grants, thesis, articles (send link to my papers). One day it struck me that not only did I enjoy writing but I also really enjoyed my editing jobs and that's when I decided I should start my own independent editing business. And here we are !
